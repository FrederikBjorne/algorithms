# Sorting algorithms
Classic sorting algorithms run with execution time on unsorted array of numbers. In order to ease extending it with more algorithms, the design uses a classic agnostic factory letting the concrete algorithms register themselves with very little effort.
Just run main.java and view the result in the print-outs.
